                        Every Friday afternoon we conduct "Sport, Art and Games". All pupils are divided into small
                        groups and then devote the whole afternoon to a topic together with selected teachers. Our offer
                        is large and very versatile. The pupils can paint, dance, make music, do yoga, explore nature,
                        drum and much more. So, we end our school week with educational extra-curricular lessons.

                        We care a lot about a holistic education of the pupils at our school. This includes the awareness
                        of nature and the environment, which we want to convey to all our pupils. Therefore, once a
                        month we dedicate two lessons to the maintenance and care of our school grounds. First the
                        pupils get a theoretical input. After that they all help in the garden. Trees have already been
                        planted and flowers sown. Picking up trash and cleaning the classrooms are also part of the
                        lessons. In this way, the children learn to treat nature and the environment with respect and
                        sustainability.

                        In this weekly program, we teach our girls to go through life with confidence, to protect and
                        value themselves and to talk about the importance of setting goals. We show them how to defend
                        themselves both physically and verbally. The program builds group cohesion among the girls and
                        it strengthens each girl for her daily life and for the future.

                        While the girls practice self-defense, we show the boys how to resolve conflicts peacefully, we
                        talk with them about the importance of treating girls and women in particular with respect, what
                        it means to set goals, etc. It is important for us to contribute to a more peaceful society and less
                        domestic violence. At the same time, it has been proven that peaceful interaction contributes to a
                        better learning atmosphere.

                        watermelon. What is special about Furaha School is that we have excellent and safe drinking water.
                        We provide the pupils with sufficient drinking water, which they have access to at all times.

                        do this in an educational way. For example, we organize annual trips to the Serengeti National
                        Park, Saanane Island, Bujora Museum, Butiama - Musoma national Museum or other interesting
                        destinations. The trips are prepared and followed up with the pupils.. These trips are always great
                        occasions for all the pupils and also for the teachers. At the same time, the exciting environment
                        and relaxed atmosphere helps strengthen the bond between the pupils and the teachers.
