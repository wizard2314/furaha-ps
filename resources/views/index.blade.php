                <p class="text-justify text-sm md:text-md font-sans font-thin ">
                    In the year 2007 the couple had the opportunity to buy the area at Nyamatala street,
                    Buhongwa ward and build the school, Furaha English Medium Pre & Primary School. They
                    believe that Education is the key to success, therefore educating children is a direct
                    contribution for the future of this country. The children themselves will contribute to their
                    community by being better educated.

                    <br><br>
                    With this in mind, and with their professional experiences as teachers and social workers,
                    Mr.Faustine Gombo and Mrs John Mohamed Hwagi decided to Open the school in 21 January
                    2008. Whereby Day care Baby classes for nursery pupils started.

                        for
                        lesson planning. Teachers regularly have the
                        opportunity to make their lessons exciting with these materials and thus arouse interest in the
                        pupils. During the lessons the teachers work with interesting models, read texts, show
                        educational films and much more. This is to create varied lessons to increase the pupil’s interest.

                        It has been proven that children's ability to concentrate declines after some time of learning.
                        Then it is time for a break to get some fresh air, to move around and to be able to start the
                        lessons again concentrated and on time. On our break areas the pupils can let off steam as they
                        please. They play football, jump rope or play on our large and well-equipped playground. Or
                        they sit down for a while relaxing in the shade and enjoying our garden with its lovely flowers.

                        At Furaha Schools we provide our pupils with an outstanding education. Our language of
                        instruction is English and we follow the Tanzanian National Curriculum. Also, we prepare all
                        pupils in the best possible way for the following years in Secondary School. Moreover, we are
                        equally strong in preparing the children for their future lives. At our school the pupils should
                        always think critically and stand up for themselves and their own opinions. It is our duty to
                        educate the children to become self-confident and reflective young people. Furthermore, it is of
                        great concern to us to put into practice what we have learned and to show the pupils how they
                        need school in their everyday life. At our school we teach life skills, as well as, social skills.
                        We
                        are convinced that these skills are the key to a successful life.
